# led-flipflop-extender
A project to control a high number of LEDs using basic microcontrollers and simple electronics components.

The project uses the Arduino board, one 74238 decoder, and eight 74574 flip-flops to control up to sixty four leds using seven pins of the arduino board.

It was based on the work on https://www.instructables.com/Led-Cube-8x8x8/. So many thanks to [chr](https://www.instructables.com/member/chr/) for sharing his work.
